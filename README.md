# LoadingBars

### This is the implementation of a more visually appealing loading bar for use in CLI applications and programs.

As a practice for me, I'm implementing the same loading bars in the basic 8 colors with
the use of ANSI escape sequences in as many languages as I can, due to the ANSI escapes
this code would not run as intended in PowerShell or CMD in Windows, but it will run in
Any Unix-like OS, WSL and Apple OS.

Currently implemented languages:
- Bash Script
- Python


		./default
	 
		To print a loading bar in the default color of your terminal.
